Saying that, even though everything appeared to be fine on the surface of social media, the years from 2018 to 2022 were the hardest of her life. And again, we can, with relative legitimacy, assume why.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>That being said, Catherine is not solely a victim of this situation. The couple has long been scrutinized for how they included their children in their public online life. A Redditor satirized her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IG statement</a>, joking:</p><p>“My husband and I are parting amicably but remain together in our desire to exploit our children for money.

But, with sufficient information, scattered here and there, we can speculate. And many netizens speculated how Catherine Paiz could endure the fact that her husband, allegedly, cheated on her. He’s denied the allegations, but the evidence and claims have come from multiple separate sources. One of these sources was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber</a> and influencer Tana Mongeau:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>one time austin mcbroom was cheating on catherine with a random bitch and she left a lipstick in his car</p><p>then i was sitting with jake in the car and he gets a facetime</p><p>it’s from austin (crying) and catherine, yelling “IS THIS TANA’S LIPSTICK AUSTIN SAYS IT IS”</p><p>(it wasn’t)</p>— Tana Mongeau (@tanamongeau) <a href=#>June 12, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Austin, of course, clapped back and diverted the focus:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>🧢 to the biggest clout chaser of them all!
