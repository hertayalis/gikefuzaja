A newspaper advert celebrating Bill Clinton's 2000 visit to India accompanied by his daughter for the second time summed it all up: "Welcome back Chelsea," it read, "And thanks for bringing your dad."</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p id=ei_h_l2qq1 data-wc=71>Chelsea Victoria Clinton was born on February 27, 1980, during her father William Jefferson Clinton's first term in office as the governor of Arkansas. The curly-haired only child of politician Bill and his attorney wife Hillary showed she was razor sharp early on. Describing her as "precocious", a family friend recalls: "As a toddler, instead of saying, 'I have to get a shot', she'd say, 'I have to get my immunisations'."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2ddb00c8cd59-gettyimages-1473698388.jpg><p id=eRhgni59y_ data-wc=75>Her parents supported her academic prowess, with dad Bill keeping a miniature desk for his daughter in the governor's office. Soon, the bright little girl was nearing her teens, excelling at her studies as she developed an interest in drama and ballet. "Responsible, trustworthy; just a darn good kid" was how Uncle Tony Rodham described her. Chelsea's relatively quiet life would change, however, when her father was elected president of the United States in 1992.&nbsp;</p><p id=eE1H95Z3DY data-wc=65>Suddenly the adolescent was in the spotlight. We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth. It's tough when you are an adolescent," said her father at the time. "But," he predicted, "I think she'll be OK." Nonetheless, the First Couple soon developed an unspoken pact with the press that Chelsea was strictly off-limits.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee816d21e2a7-gettyimages-617399978.jpg><p id=eck8EL79ON data-wc=88>With her parents trying to provide as normal a life as possible for her, Chelsea became a vegetarian, dreamed of being a pediatric cardiologist, and reportedly earned the Secret Service code name "Energy". And like any dad, Bill would worry when his 16-year-old daughter went out at night with friends. "Whenever she goes out, I wait up until she comes home, even though the Secret Service is with her," he said in 1996. "Maybe it is old-fashioned, but I just can't go to bed until she is there."&nbsp;</p><p id=eMJOpR9tLn data-wc=99>The protection her parents sought to give her with the press, at least came to an end when Chelsea decided to attend Stanford University in California. It was then that she began to make headlines on her own, much to the chagrin of her mum and dad, with her blossoming relationships with Stanford swimmer Matthew Pierce and former White House intern Jeremy Kane. And it was during her years as a Stanford student she first earned a reputation for grace under pressure, symbolically clasping the hands of both parents in public as the Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light.&nbsp;</p><p id=etx_sgUtET data-wc=31>"Chelsea is crucial to the family's balance," said Clinton biographer David Maraniss. "She is the one person her father could love unconditionally, and she is the centre of Hillary's emotional life."&nbsp;</p><h2>Professional life and education</h2><p id=eiMiCWNX5o data-wc=54>In 2001, Chelsea delivered her 167-page thesis on the Northern Ireland peace process (for which she interviewed, among others, her father) and set her sights on Britain's Oxford University where would pursue studies in International Relations. It was during her time at the prestigious institution that Chelsea began to take on true celebrity status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bcb3a8169982-gettyimages-103186143.jpg><p id=eZ2Hxs0shF data-wc=52>&nbsp;She set flashbulbs popping in 2002 when she sat front row with pals <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Madonna</a> and <a aria-label='\"Biography' class=hm-link href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> at Versace's Paris show sporting a sleek new look. And it was that year she began her first high-profile relationship, with Rhodes Scholar Ian Klaus, the son of an exercise equipment mogul and horse breeder.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNhqc9alSXB data-wc=58>Having learned some lessons during her many years as the First Daughter, however, Chelsea is savvy when it comes to maintaining a romance in the public eye. "I try not to thrust Ian into the limelight I don't think that's good for any relationship," she says. "It's going great, and I would like it to continue that way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa65be2a1ea5-gettyimages-610819270.jpg><p id=ePmoKm2VBu data-wc=68>&nbsp;Following her time at Oxford, Chelsea moved back to the States, living in New York and working for a Wall Street hedge fund. Despite Chelsea's desire to lead her life away from the public eye and her self-imposed blanket ban on speaking to the press about her parents’ political endeavours, she stepped into the spotlight to support her mother's presidential campaign in the run-up to the 2009 elections.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBS-SGJWgN data-wc=44>And the former first daughter generated yet more headlines at the end of 2009. It was announced that she had gotten engaged to longtime love Marc Mezvinsky, a former intern in her father's White House who was working for Goldman Sachs at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/869141f6c3bc-gettyimages-1439559766.jpg><p id=eXgOu7eFPL data-wc=73>&nbsp;In an email to their friends, they confirmed the happy news, writing: “We're sorry for the mass email but we wanted to wish everyone a belated Happy Thanksgiving! We also wanted to share that we are engaged! We didn't get married this past summer despite the stories to the contrary, but we are looking toward next summer and hope you all will be there to celebrate with us. Happy Holidays! Chelsea & Marc.”</p><p id=eUkp0P0-mF data-wc=127>&nbsp;It seems her parents were happy with her choice of future husband, as Bill described him as a “great human being” one month later. No doubt he has much in common with his in-laws - he's the son of former US congressman Edward Mezvinsky and former US congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky. His mother once ran for Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. So the wheels were in motion to organize what was set to be the society event of 2010, with the date set for late July. Very few details were known about the nuptials, which have been shrouded in secrecy. Those 'in the know' were under strict instructions to keep quiet – however, experts reported that the cost of the celebrations was anywhere between £2 million and £3.2 million.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9qbmVksKmxy6ycmmWTobavwM6nZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchelsea-clinton.html&text=Chelsea%20Clinton%20-%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchelsea-clinton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchelsea-clinton.html&title=Chelsea%20Clinton%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchelsea-clinton.html&title=Chelsea%20Clinton%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchelsea-clinton.html&title=Chelsea%20Clinton%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchelsea-clinton.html&description=Chelsea%20Clinton%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jamal-mashburn-net-worth-248402.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamal Mashburn Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./baby-reindeer-fans-think-they-have-found-richard-gadds-real-life-stalker-martha.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Baby Reindeer fans think they have found Richard Gadd's real-life stalker 'Martha'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
