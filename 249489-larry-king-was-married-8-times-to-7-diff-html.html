At 18, he exchanged vows with his young lover, Freda Miller. However, their parents were allegedly not pleased with the new marital development and had the marriage annulled the following year.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ANNETTE KAYE: 1961</strong></p><p class=dh>In yet another eventful marital stint, the Late Larry King found love once again in the arms of Annette Kaye in 1961.

Two years after they were married, she divorced him.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALENE AKINS: 1968-1971</strong></p><p class=dh>Ever a man of compassion, King reignited his love with his third wife, Akins.
