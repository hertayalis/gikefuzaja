Jackson has appeared in several movies and tv series such as <i>Glee, 30 Rock</i>, and so on.</p><p>Lapka and Jackson have separated for more than a decade now. Who is Monte dating now? Let's see his love life while we explore the enigmatic life of Cheyenne's ex-husband.</p><h2>Is Monte Lapka Still Cheyenne Jackson's Husband?</h2><p>No, Monte Lapka and Cheyenne Jackson are not married anymore. The former couple parted in 2013. Lapka and Jackson were a gay couple just like <a href=#><strong>Tuc Watkins and Andrew Rannells</strong></a> whose married life was short-lived for only three years.</p><p>Cheyenne and Monte tied the knot in 2010. They were in a relationship for 9 years before taking their love life to the next level. The lavish wedding took place in Hamptons, New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/17/Monte%20Lapka%20and%20his%20ex-husband%20Cheyenne%20Jackson-1692258524603.jpg><p>However, after marriage, the love between Lapka and Jackson apparently faded. It was reported that the former couple started living separately before their divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>Before their divorce, Jackson did wish his husband a birthday. He wrote:</p><p>"Happy Birthday, honey… you lovely, witty, sensitive lover of life.”</p><p>Many people believe that Jackson and Lapka split because of Cheyenne's drinking problem. But, the Physicist has not disclosed the divorce reason officially yet.</p><h2>Who Is Cheyenne Jackson's Ex-husband Dating Now?</h2><p>Monte Lapka has now been living a private life. Due to this, the celebrity ex-husband's personal life is out of media reach. He may be single or might have found solace in another's arms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/17/Monte%20Lapka's%20ex-husband%20is%20married%20to%20Jason%20Landau-1692258450979.jpg"><p>On the other hand, Cheyenne Jackson has said "I Do" for the second time. Yes, the American actor met his new husband J<strong>ason Landau</strong> in 2013 in rehab for alcohol dependence and they began dating shortly.</p><p>Jackson and Landau married on September 13, 2014, in an outdoor wedding at a friend's estate in Encino, California in front of 200 guests. The notable guests in their marriage are <strong>Jane Lynch, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, </strong>and<strong> Alicia Silverstone.</strong></p><p>Now the husband and wife duo have been together for a decade. And, their married life is still going strong.</p><h3>The Ex-Husband Of Monte Lapka Has Two Children</h3><p>While Lapka's love life is out of media reach, his ex-husband is doing pretty well. Cheyenne Jackson became the father of two fraternal twins Willow and Ethan in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/17/Cheyenne%20Jackson%20and%20Jason%20Landau's%20children-1692258288465.jpg"><p>Jason and Cheyenne have been amazing parents like Jonathan Banks and <a href=#><strong>Gennera Banks</strong></a>. The kids are quite happy with them. The family of four is seen going on vacations and celebrating.</p><p>Ethan and Willow are school-going kids.
