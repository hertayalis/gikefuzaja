He was born on July 2, 1989, and in 2015 and 2016, respectively, his songs "Darlin'" and "You Want Me" were hits. Both songs were awarded silver and platinum BPI certifications, with "You Want Me" reaching the charts in the UK, Belgium, and Ireland.<p>At the age of 17, Zanetti started his musical career by performing in different bars. Since then, he has grown in popularity in the music business and has worked with well-known musicians including Karen Harding, Sadie Ama, and Preditah.</p><p>Zanetti has a career in television in addition to music. In 2021, he took part in the eleventh season of the reality series "Celebs Go Dating: The Mansion." During filming of the show, Zanetti defied convention and began dating Sophie Hermann, a fellow celebrity from "Made in Chelsea." Together, the couple exited the show.</p><p>Zanetti made his debut in the sport of boxing on October 15, 2022, at the Sheffield Arena. Jack Bean, his first rival, withdrew due to mental health issues. When Jayden King, his second opponent, realized he couldn't make weight, he withdrew, and the two of them charged at the press conference. Following King's withdrawal from the fight, Zanetti was eventually taken off the fight card. Zanetti nevertheless agreed to a three-fight contract with Misfits Boxing in October 2022.</p><p>Despite his triumphs, Zanetti has encountered some controversy over the course of his career. For example, he has come under fire for using explicit language in his tracks and for engaging in a public spat with fellow DJ and producer Marvin Humes. Despite this, Zanetti has persisted in advancing his musical career and establishing a name for himself in the entertainment sector..</p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire Tom Zanetti for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire Tom Zanetti or research availability and pricing for booking Tom Zanetti to perform at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire Tom Zanetti as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking Tom Zanetti to perform.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like Tom Zanetti in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming. They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Tom Zanetti or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>Tom Zanetti's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Tom Zanetti for your party. As long as your funding is commensurate with the price range to book Tom Zanetti, CTI will propose your event to the official agency representing Tom Zanetti. After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.</p><p>CTI can give you the accurate Tom Zanetti booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. "How much does it cost to book Tom Zanetti for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Tom Zanetti booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Tom Zanetti charge for an event. An example fee to book Tom Zanetti is in the starting range of $15,000-$24,999. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Tom Zanetti for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Tom Zanetti agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Tom Zanetti, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Tom Zanetti booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Tom Zanetti, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Performer</p><p><b>Style</b><br>Rap-Hip Hop</p><p><b>Range</b><br>Rap-Hip Hop, Male, Age Group-18-30's, British</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COa3BtcGZkwbC5jLOYp52kqbZw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsampletalent.html&text=Hire%20Tom%20Zanetti%20for%20a%20Corporate%20Event%20or%20Performance%20Booking.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsampletalent.html&title=Hire%20Tom%20Zanetti%20for%20a%20Corporate%20Event%20or%20Performance%20Booking." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsampletalent.html&title=Hire%20Tom%20Zanetti%20for%20a%20Corporate%20Event%20or%20Performance%20Booking." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsampletalent.html&title=Hire%20Tom%20Zanetti%20for%20a%20Corporate%20Event%20or%20Performance%20Booking." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsampletalent.html&description=Hire%20Tom%20Zanetti%20for%20a%20Corporate%20Event%20or%20Performance%20Booking." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mark-lerner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Mark Lerner new owner of Washington Nationals and Lerner Enterprises right replacement for Ted Le">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./glenn-dorsey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Glenn Dorsey">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
