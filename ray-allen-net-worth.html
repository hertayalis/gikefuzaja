Vince Carter’s net worth is roughly $110 Million.</p><p>Vince Carter is an American former professional NBA player.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter is the only player in NBA history to play 22 seasons; the only player to play in four different decades.</p><p>He was one of the oldest active NBA players until he announced his retirement in 2020.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vincent Lamar Carter was born on the 26th of January, 1977, in Florida.</p><p>Carter is the son of Vince and Michelle Carter.</p><p>His parents divorced when he was only seven years old, following which his mother, a school teacher, remarried Harry Robinson, also a school teacher.</p><p>Young Carter was equally talented in music and sports and was encouraged by his mother and stepfather to pursue both to have a well-rounded upbringing.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vince Carter was originally drafted by the Golden State Warriors in the 1998 NBA Draft but was traded for <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/antawn-jamison-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148465 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Antawn Jamison</u></a> to the Toronto Raptors.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter proved to be instrumental in helping the Raptors make their first playoff appearance in 2000, and he earned the Rookie of the Year award.&nbsp;</p><p>By his second season, he had become an NBA superstar, and at the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend, he led one of the most memorable Slam Dunk Contests.&nbsp;</p><p>During his third season, he averaged 27.6 points per game and was made a starter in the 2001 NBA All-Star Game.&nbsp;</p><h3>An NBA Leader</h3><p>In August 2001, Vince Carter signed a six-year contract extension for $94 million but missed 22 games that season due to injury.&nbsp;</p><p>However, soon after, Carter joined <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/charles-barkley-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148466 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Charles Barkley</u></a> as the second player to ever finish with 15 rebounds, 15 rebounds, five assists, and five steals.&nbsp;</p><p>While he was voted to the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, he missed out due to requiring surgery, and the following season only played 43 games.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2003, Carter gave up his place in the All-Star Game to <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/michael-jordan-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148467 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Michael Jordan</u></a>, allowing the legend to make his final start as an All-Star.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, the Raptors’ new general manager traded Carter to the New Jersey Nets, and he quickly became hated by Toronto fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, he didn’t let this bring him down, and during the 2005 season, he helped the Nets to the second round of the playoffs.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Nets, The Magic, And The Suns</h3><p>During the 2006-07 season, Carter and <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/jason-kidd-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148468 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Jason Kidd</u></a> became the first team to record triple-doubles in the same game since <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/scottie-pippen-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148469 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Scottie Pippen</u></a> and Michael Jordan.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, he re-signed with the Nets for four years and $61.8 million, and in the 2008-09 season, he was made the captain of the Nets.&nbsp;</p><p>After recording his fifth triple-double in 2009, in June, he was traded with Ryan Anderson to the Orlando Magic, where he scored a season-high 48 points in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the year, he helped the Magic reach the Eastern Conference Finals and, the following season, was traded to the Phoenix Suns.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Suns, he reached 20,000 career points and became the 37th NBA player to reach that threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after the NBA Lockout, Carter was waived by the Suns, having appeared in 51 games with 41 starts.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Mavericks, Grizzlies, And The Kings</h3><p>Vince Carter signed a three-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 and reunited with his former teammate Jason Kidd.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Mavericks, Carter became known for his three-pointers and passed <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/larry-bird-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148470 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Larry Bird</u></a> on the NBA’s career scoring list.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2014, he had raised his total career points to 23,010 and became the 27th player to pass the 23,000 mark.&nbsp;</p><p>Later that year, he signed a multi-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies but appeared in only one of the first 12 games of the 2015-16 season.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, he won the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award for his leadership both on and off the court.&nbsp;</p><p>The following season, Carter played his 1,278th game and became the 24th player to surpass 24,000 points.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, he signed a one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings and was named the Most Influential Veteran by the NBA Players Association.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the season, he also earned the NBPA’s Backbone Award and its Most Respected Award at the Players Voice Awards.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Atlanta Hawks</h3><p>Following his year with the Kings, Vince Carter signed with the Atlanta Hawks and made his debut against the Knicks in October 2018.</p><p>At this point, he was the second-oldest player in NBA history to start at 41 years and 264 days old.</p><p>Later, he became the oldest player in NBA history to score 20+ points, breaking <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/kareem-abdul-jabbar-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=148471 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s</u></a> record.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2019, he <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/06/05/vince-carter-announces-retirement/1360206001/ data-lasso-id=148472 data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><u>planned to retire</u></a> at the end of the season, re-signing for one year with the Hawks.&nbsp;</p><p>By December, he became the fifth player in history to play 1,500 games and the only player to have played in four different decades.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter played his final game on March 11, 2020, against the New York Knicks, making his last three-pointer during the final seconds of the match.&nbsp;</p><p>He officially announced his retirement on June 25, 2020, and went on to sign with ESPN as an NBA and college basketball analyst.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section

hurt my feelings… I’m not coming at you, what I’m saying is that I’m willing to take that heat for my team, if we’re playing well or if we’re not playing well.” <strong>– Vince Carter</strong></p><p>“I think people are going to like my new shoes.

In the books, when you look at it 10 or 20 years from now, it’s not going say how he got here, it’s going to say he’s here and he represented the team.” <strong>– Vince Carter</strong></p><p>“Teams tend to double off him sometimes and leave him open. He’s shooting with confidence. If he plays with aggression, it puts a lot of pressure on some big men. And if he attacks shot-blockers, it helps us get in the lane a little easier.”&nbsp;<strong>– Vince Carter</strong></p><p>“It’s always fun; it’s not like it hurts my feelings or anything; that’s just the way it is… It’s just basketball at its finest.
