Gen. John Lubas, deputy commander of the 101st Airborne Division.</p><p>No other civilian casualties or injuries were reported as both Black Hawks crash-landed in an open field.</p><p>Additionally, the crashed helicopters were just two of four in the exercise on Wednesday night, 101st Airborne Division spokesman Staff Sgt.
