Now, three years and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million deal</a> later, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glass Onion</a></strong>, the first of at least two Netflix sequels, has arrived with a brand new case and some more eccentric and annoyingly wealthy&nbsp;characters (played by some of our favorite movie stars). &nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=622 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>In Glass Onion, Benoit Blanc returns for a murder mystery themed party at a billionaire’s lavish Greek Island but when someone turns up dead, everyone on the island — including the billionaire and his closest friends — becomes a suspect. Joining Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc is a star-studded cast that includes Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Jessica Henwick, Madelyn Cline,&nbsp;Kate Hudson, and Dave Bautista.&nbsp;Thanks to the popularity of the initial Knives Out installment, writer/director Rian Johnson is also able to draft a similarly star-studded cameo cast, let’s detail them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-greatest-of-zoom-calls data-injectable=false><strong>The Greatest of Zoom Calls</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Early in the film, we find out that Benoit Blanc has been struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. As someone who naturally struggles between solving cases, the prolonged lack of any mystery to solve has hit him hard,&nbsp;and like many of us who struggled in one way or another during the early days of the pandemic, he has turned to both Zoom and the online multiplayer game, Among Us. We find Blanc – in a bathtub – playing&nbsp;the game (and on a Zoom call) with a quartet of very famous faces. &nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Angela Lansbury</strong>&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Getty-Images-Angela-Lansbury.jpg><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>The most apt of all the film’s cameos is the appearance of Dame Angela Lansbury DBE, playing herself, as one of Blanc’s Zoom participants. This is a perfect tie-in with the murder-mystery element of the film as Dame Angela Lansbury’s most famous role, out of her many, many roles was that of Jessica Fletcher, the lead character in the murder mystery series Murder She Wrote, which she played for over 12 years. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>Sadly, this is one of two bittersweet cameos as Dame Lansbury passed away in October 2022 and this was her final, posthumous film role. &nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Stephen Sondheim</strong>&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Stephen-Sondheim-New-York-Times.jpg><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The other bittersweet cameo is the appearance of legendary composer and lyricist, Stephen Sondheim, on Benoit Blanc’s Zoom call. Stephen Sondheim was one of the preeminent composers and lyricists of the twentieth century, having been responsible for West Side Story, Into the Woods, and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, to name a few from a very long list. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true>However, he also co-wrote the 1973 murder mystery film, The Last of Sheila, which Rian Johnson admits was a huge influence on Glass Onion. Another Stephen Sondheim work that heavily influenced Glass Onion was his 1981 play, Merrily We Roll Along. Rian Johnson explained that he was listening to Merrily We Roll Along “over and over” as he was writing and that there are several lines from the play planted throughout the film. Additionally, there is a poster for the play in Benoit Blanc’s apartment. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Sadly, Stephen Sondheim also passed away in November 2021. Dame Lansbury is connected to Stephen Sondheim as well, as she originated the role of Mrs. Lovett in his 1979 play, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>The film is dedicated to both of them. &nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Natasha Lyonne</strong>&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Getty-Images-Natasha-Lyonne.jpg><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>The third participant in Benoit Blanc’s Zoom call and game of Among Us is Emmy-nominated actress, Natasha Lyonne. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Natasha Lyonne has been acting professionally for over thirty years but is perhaps best known for her performances in the American Pie series, Orange is the New Black and for co-creating, writing, directing, and starring in Russian Doll. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>Her cameo here also carries a meta aspect as Natasha Lyonne will next be starring in and producing the Rian Johnson created murder mystery TV show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Poker Face</a>, which Rian Johnson is currently attached to direct. &nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</strong>&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Getty-Images-Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar.jpg><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Just when we thought this Zoom call could not get any more famous, it is rounded off by the presence of Basketball legend, author, and activist, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=98 data-injectable=false>We wonder how many cases we would have to solve to be invited to a Zoom call this star-studded. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Yo-Yo Ma</strong>&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Yo-Yo-Ma.jpg><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>Speaking of legends, famed cellist and child prodigy, Yo-Yo Ma appears at a party being thrown by Kate Hudson’s Birdie Jay (she hilariously notes that it is not breaking COVID lockdown rules because everyone at the party is in her bubble). &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>Yo-Yo Ma helps the group of friends solve a puzzle — sent by Edward Norton’s Miles Bron — that involves one of Bach’s fugues. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Ethan Hawke</strong>&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Getty-Images-Ethan-Hawke.jpg><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Sporting a ponytail version of his very recognizable&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moon Knight</a> look, Ethan Hawke appears as a character simply referred to as “Efficient Man”. He appears to be the assistant to the billionaire Miles and seems to provide a COVID-19 vaccine to all the guests before they board the boat to the island — this is months before any such vaccine was available to the general public. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Serena Williams </strong>&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Serena-Williams.jpg><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>When you’re a billionaire who can afford his own private island, you can also afford private training sessions from one of the greatest sports stars ever — and that is exactly what Miles does. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>Tennis superstar Serena Williams appears as herself and a trainer that Miles has paid for in the film. For a while in the scene, you are led to believe that it is just a stock image of the tennis legend before she begins to move and eventually asks the other people in the scene whether they are going to start a lesson or just wait around (since she’s getting paid either way). It is a moment that has consistently been very well received across screenings. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Hugh Grant</strong>&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Getty-Images-Hugh-Grant.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Perhaps no other cameo receives as big a reaction as the appearance of rom-com legend and Paddington 2 star, Hugh Grant. He appears as Phillip, Benoit Blanc’s domestic partner. We hear his voice offscreen early in the film, but we do not see his face till much later, at the beginning of the third act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Apart from the obvious exhilaration at seeing a star like Hugh Grant unexpectedly appear, not playing himself, the presence of Phillip here confirms Benoit Blanc as queer. Of course, this also means that we could see Hugh Grant reprise this role in future installments.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Other ‘Appearances’</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true><strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong> continues his tradition of appearing in every Rian Johnson feature film. This time he hilariously cameos as the voice of the hourly dong on Miles’ Island, this is in addition to his voice cameo as Detective Hardrock in the first Knives Out and a previous voice cameo as Slowen Lo in Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=701 data-current-count=701 data-injectable=true>To complete the carousel of famous people, a few more celebrities are mentioned, although never seen (or heard). <strong>Jared Leto</strong> has a brand of hard kombucha that is ingested poolside, so much so that one character ends up getting drunk off it.&nbsp;<strong>Jeremy Renner </strong>has his own branded hot sauce that plays a pivotal role in the plot and in the eventual solving of the crime. Finally, Miles Bron mentions to Benoit Blanc that he hired <strong>Gillian Flynn</strong>, of Gone Girl and Sharp Objects fame, to write the plotline for his murder mystery party – a mystery that Benoit manages to solve in less than five minutes, but we wouldn’t blame her for that because even Benoit acknowledges that she is “very good.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>All these fun cameos, along with a brilliant script and very good performances lead to a thrilling and exciting murder mystery ride that you can catch in select cinemas for a full week from November 23rd and on Netflix worldwide on December 23rd. &nbsp;</p><p class=has-medium-font-size data-characters=0 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Syt7HRsmSgpJGowG67zaKmp2WRYrivtdWeqmanpal6rsXSrZyrsV2Yrq6xzmacsaiclravscNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-cameo-explained.html&text=Every%20Glass%20Onion%3a%20A%20Knives%20Out%20Mystery%20cameo%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-cameo-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-cameo-explained.html&title=Every%20Glass%20Onion%3a%20A%20Knives%20Out%20Mystery%20cameo%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-cameo-explained.html&title=Every%20Glass%20Onion%3a%20A%20Knives%20Out%20Mystery%20cameo%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-cameo-explained.html&title=Every%20Glass%20Onion%3a%20A%20Knives%20Out%20Mystery%20cameo%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-cameo-explained.html&description=Every%20Glass%20Onion%3a%20A%20Knives%20Out%20Mystery%20cameo%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-high-do-you-mount-a-washer-box-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How high do you mount a washer box?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./econ-and-me.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Econ and Me | PBS">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
