If you know anything about the entertainment world, you'll know that the acting duo set the internet alight with their sizzling chemistry while filming for the flick.</p><p>Anyone But You is out on 26 December, so not long to wait. Both Glen and Sydney have spoken out about the <a href=#>“affair” and relationship rumours</a> that have swirled the Internet since they were filming.</p><p>In an interview with <a data-offer-url=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a45721910/glen-powell-anyone-but-you-interview/ class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a45721910/glen-powell-anyone-but-you-interview/"}' href=# rel=noopener>Men's Health</a>, Glen opened up about feeling uncomfortable with the rumours about their “alleged affair” at first, but has grown used to it as part of the job.</p><p>“When all that stuff happened, you know, publicly, it felt disorienting and unfair,” he said. "But what I’m realising is that's just a part of this gig now," he said of what he called "the alleged affair."</p><p>Sydney was also asked by <a href=#>Variety</a> whether she had an offscreen romance with her co-star. "It's a rom-com. That's what people want!" she answered.</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure><p>“Glen and I don't really care. We have so much fun together, and we respect each other so much; he's such a hard worker, and I'm a hard worker,” she added, explaining that it's fun to play up to the rumours sometimes to the press and the fans.</p><p>“They want it,” she added. “It’s fun to give it to ’em.”</p><p>Here's what we know so far about Anyone But You.</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure>What have we discovered from the Anyone But You trailer?<p>While they clearly got on like a house on fire IRL, it appears by the trailer (and the title of the movie) that their characters actually cannot stand each other. In fact, they are college arch-rivals who, after reuniting years after graduation for a <a href=#>destination wedding</a>, are forced to pretend to be lovers for reasons that are yet not very clear to us.</p><p>Cue the fuming pair eye-rolling while in each other's company while in the depths of Sydney, Australia, before concocting a plan to tell their friends that they are actually together. “There's no way we can actually convince everyone we actually like each other?”Glen's Ben says before a further slew of clips showing them recoiling at the prospects of holding hands and acting lovey-dovey. But will the pair actually fall in <a href=#>love</a>? You'll have to watch the movie to find out!</p><figure data-testid=IframeEmbed class="IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg hZcniq iframe-embed"></figure><p>The trailer involving the <a href=#>Euphoria</a> and Top Gun: Maverick stars comes after there was plenty of evidence of them getting on like a house on fire – having appeared in a number of Instagram posts together as well as BTS shots from the set of the film. It was announced <a href=#>in January</a> that Sydney and Glen would be teaming up on the “rated R” romantic comedy, which is directed by Will Gluck – known for Easy A and Friends With Benefits – and also stars Never Have I Ever's Darren Barnet and Dermot Mulroney.</p><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure><figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset"></span></figure><p>The cast filmed in Sydney, Australia, with fans becoming increasingly excited about the movie based on the pictures that emerged from the set.</p><p>It seems that the film's whole crew got on like a house on fire during production since there have been numerous posts on Instagram from their time Down Under.</p><p>Glen even <a data-offer-url=https://www.instagram.com/glenpowell/ class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/glenpowell/"}' href=# rel=noopener>shared pictures</a> from a visit to Taronga Zoo, which showed Sydney posing with members of his family who had flown out to visit him in Australia. <a data-offer-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqwsxv9Lmav/ class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqwsxv9Lmav/"}' href=# rel=noopener>Posts from Darren's Instagram</a> also show the cast hanging out regularly together, as he wrote: “WE LOVE SYDNEY… @sydney_sweeney is pretty awesome too. So grateful to be surrounded by such amazing cast mates that I am lucky enough to call friends.” <a href=#>Sydney</a> herself adorably commented on the post: “Don’t want this to end!”</p><p>Other behind-the-scenes pictures from the film show Glen taking part in some action sequences, as well as he and Sydney in their swimwear on a yacht – and kissing in front of the Sydney Opera House.</p><p>Either way, fans have taken to social media to comment on the obvious chemistry between the pair.</p><p>"Either Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have the greatest chemistry since Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, or they’re doing it together every weekend," one joked on Twitter. Another added: “Yeah I’m very much seated for that new rom com with Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell… the chemistry is perfect.”</p><p>Something tells us this movie is going to be just as talked-about as <a href=#>Don't Worry Darling</a>, if the noise surrounding it is to be believed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauqp2WtKLGyKecZ5ufY8Kse8Crq6KbnJp8tMXDp5yyZaOssqa6xLJkoKSVo3qxu9aeo6Vllp65rnnAp7CoppVir7bAjLKmrg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsydney-sweeney-glen-powell-film-anyone-but-you.html&text=Sydney%20Sweeney%20And%20Glen%20Powell%27s%20Romcom%20Anyone%20But%20You%20With%20Their%20Incredible%20BTS%20Chemistry%20Is%20Coming&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsydney-sweeney-glen-powell-film-anyone-but-you.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsydney-sweeney-glen-powell-film-anyone-but-you.html&title=Sydney%20Sweeney%20And%20Glen%20Powell%27s%20Romcom%20Anyone%20But%20You%20With%20Their%20Incredible%20BTS%20Chemistry%20Is%20Coming" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsydney-sweeney-glen-powell-film-anyone-but-you.html&title=Sydney%20Sweeney%20And%20Glen%20Powell%27s%20Romcom%20Anyone%20But%20You%20With%20Their%20Incredible%20BTS%20Chemistry%20Is%20Coming" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsydney-sweeney-glen-powell-film-anyone-but-you.html&title=Sydney%20Sweeney%20And%20Glen%20Powell%27s%20Romcom%20Anyone%20But%20You%20With%20Their%20Incredible%20BTS%20Chemistry%20Is%20Coming" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsydney-sweeney-glen-powell-film-anyone-but-you.html&description=Sydney%20Sweeney%20And%20Glen%20Powell%27s%20Romcom%20Anyone%20But%20You%20With%20Their%20Incredible%20BTS%20Chemistry%20Is%20Coming" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-nails-do-i-use-for-fence-panels-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What nails do I use for fence panels?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sasha-roiz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sasha Roiz">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
