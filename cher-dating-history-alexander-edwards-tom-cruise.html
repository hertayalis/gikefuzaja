Despite the 40 years between them, Cher said that they get along great. “He's fabulous. And I don't give men qualities that they don't deserve” she said on the Kelly Clarkson Show.</p><p id=eJ0_Qy7qOmw data-wc=65>Even though they get on great, Cher acknowledged that their age gap is noticeable. "Sometimes I’m talking to him and he has no idea who I’m talking about … The other day, I said, ‘Do you know who, I don’t know, Clark Gable, [is]?’ Somebody said, ‘Yes, of course,’ but most of my references … He’ll look at me and go, ‘I wasn’t born yet,'"</p><p id=eKm207GiANz data-wc=56>That doesn’t mean they have nothing in common though. "We can talk music. We can talk about everything. He's got a great sense of humor, he’s got the cutest son in the world, ever … We just get each other." Alexander shares a son, Slash Electric, 4, with ex-girlfriend Amber Rose, who is 40 years old.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Cher opens doors to private home and it's a total wonderland</figure><h2>Warren Beatty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e6703b1aa25-gettyimages-496558892.jpg><p id=emVMVluI_l data-wc=26>When Cher was only 16 years old, she had a brief romance with 25-year-old movie star Warren Beatty, but the couple met in an unusual way.</p><p id=e4wbVoaJcNQ data-wc=51>When she first got her driving license, the star used to drive down Sunset Boulevard in her stepfather Gilbert’s Skylark. It was when she was passing the Strip’s famous celebrity hangout, Schwab’s Pharmacy, that she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Elle</a> that she was nearly run down by a man in a white Lincoln convertible.</p><p id=e7gL9ryd3dp data-wc=37>“Are you nuts?” she said to the driver, shaken by the near-accident. Suddenly, she recognized the man who had almost wrecked her stepfather’s car. “I looked at his face, and I thought, my god, it's Warren Beatty."</p><p id=eSXCIa62w1k data-wc=39>“But you can’t call it a relationship,” Cher said. “It was very Warren”, potentially referring to the actor’s reputation as a lothario linked to hundreds of other women, from Joan Collins to Diane Keaton to Julie Christie to <a class=hm-link href=#>Madonna</a>.</p><h2>Sonny Bono</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f409db8dc67-gettyimages-112003868.jpg><p id=e0MZR7avhi data-wc=43>Not long after her relationship with Warren Beatty, Cher met her first husband, Sonny Bono.

By 1992, David came out as gay.</p><p id=e6Gon_hhGJb data-wc=65>Cher<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>one of the most enduring gay icons ever, said of the relationship: “I was the first person to share his bed and to share his life,” speaking to Tom King for a book about Geffen, The Operator. “People don’t believe that, or they don’t want to believe it, or they don’t understand how it could be. But we were really crazy about each other.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Elvis Presley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03ad17863dd3-gettyimages-73908860.jpg><p id=e5ZVd9dLeD data-wc=23>There was a period of time in the mid-1970s where Cher almost went on a date with the <a class=hm-link href=#>King of Rock n Roll</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=ed4IQxCAYw7 data-wc=23>However, she backed out: "Almost, I got nervous, I didn't get there [to the date], I was that nervous.

Together they had a son, Elijah Blue Allman, born in 1976.&nbsp;</p><p id=eb9wKegbfyK data-wc=58>The couple worked on a collaborative album titled ‘Two the Hard Way’, which was a massive failure on release.

Gene has called Cher his first love.</p><p id=eB27TqsWZ1I data-wc=34>At the time, Kiss famously sported face paint during public appearances and had yet to reveal their bare faces to the world. When the couple appeared together, often the Kiss musician’s face was half-covered.</p><p id=etL5m0fCuPP data-wc=21>While dating Cher, however, Gene fell in love with <a class=hm-link href=#>Diana Ross</a> and would later move in with the ‘Upside Down’ singer.</p><h2>Val Kilmer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ffcbf089ed0c-cher-boyfriend.jpg><p id=eh84RIhSKG data-wc=53>By the 1980s, Cher was known for her controversial lifestyle of tattoos, plastic surgery, exhibitionist fashion sense and relationships with younger men like Val Kilmer. 13 years her junior, Val and Cher met at a birthday party and the Moonstruck star said: “We became friends because we laughed at the same things constantly.”</p><p id=e4s7F_9RVZ3 data-wc=30>The duo bonded over “our sense of humor, and what we would put up with from one another, was more than I think I've ever had with any other guy.&nbsp;</p><p id=euc---esnW9 data-wc=40>“He would just go off and do his own thing and you just had to be prepared.
